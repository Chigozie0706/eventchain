To change this, you should override\n this function so it returns a different value.\n We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\n instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless\n conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC-20\n applications."

This can be worked around by making\n those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry\n points to them.\n TIP: If EIP-1153 (transient storage) is available on the chain you're deploying at,\n consider using {ReentrancyGuardTransient} instead.\n TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways\n to protect against it, check out our blog post\n https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul]."

Skips emitting an {Approval} event indicating an allowance update. This is not required by the ERC. See {xref-ERC20-_approve-address-address-uint256-bool-}[_approve]. NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance is the maximum `uint256`. Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `value`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `value`.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/mocks/MockERC677.sol\":\"MockERC677\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC6093.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x880da465c203cec76b10d72dbd87c80f387df4102274f23eea1f9c9b0918792b\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://399594cd8bb0143bc9e55e0f1d071d0d8c850a394fb7a319d50edd55d9ed822b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmbPZzgtT6LEm9CMqWfagQFwETbV1ztpECBB1DtQHrKiRz\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x6ef9389a2c07bc40d8a7ba48914724ab2c108fac391ce12314f01321813e6368\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b7a5cb39b1e6df68f4dd9a5e76e853d745a74ffb3dfd7df4ae4d2ace6992a171\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPbzKR19rdM8X3PLQjsmHRepUKhvoZnedSR63XyGtXZib\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe06a3f08a987af6ad2e1c1e774405d4fe08f1694b67517438b467cecf0da0ef7\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://df6f0c459663c9858b6cba2cda1d14a7d05a985bed6d2de72bd8e78c25ee79db\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeTTxZ7qVk9rjEv2R4CpCwdf8UMCcRqDNMvzNxHc3Fnn9\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x70f2f713b13b7ce4610bcd0ac9fec0f3cc43693b043abcb8dc40a42a726eb330\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c13d13304ac79a83ab1c30168967d19e2203342ebbd6a9bbce4db7550522dcbf\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeN5jKMN2vw5bhacr6tkg78afbTTZUeaacNHqjWt4Ew1r\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]},\"contracts/mocks/MockERC677.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x4675a31827ebd34c372d70a37a927da85e2931f493a2164fdbad3d4698acca17\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://db4b511a63b2f4b18054245411e00fb2364e01b369b5e81a8b984e6862dd7b3b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeFkLpSLVoGV7Q6AMoj6s7Pfm911uRL59HgGdZUpjtfnz\"]}},\"version\":1}"
